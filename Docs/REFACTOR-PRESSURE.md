# Refactor Pressure Notes

> **Purpose:** Track areas of the codebase under known refactor pressure, document the technical debt they represent, and provide prioritized guidance for future cleanup. This document is the canonical source for the "Refactor pressure notes" surface referenced in the Developer Portal storyboard.

---

## How to Use This Document

Each entry describes a **pressure area**: a part of the codebase that is functional today but is accumulating structural debt. Entries are grouped by priority — High, Medium, and Low — based on how much they affect future development velocity. When a pressure area is resolved, move its entry to the **Resolved Pressure** archive table at the bottom of this document. If the resolution corresponds to a new phase of work, also mark that phase complete in `PHASES-ROADMAP.md`.

## High Pressure

These areas actively slow down new feature development and increase the risk of regression.

### 1. OfficeBrokerOrchestrator — Monolithic Coordinator

| | |
|---|---|
| **Files** | `DailyDesk.Core/Services/OfficeBrokerOrchestrator.cs`, `DailyDesk.Core/Services/MLPipelineCoordinator.cs` |
| **Size** | ~3,850 lines |
| **Phase introduced** | Phase 1 (grew through Phase 9) |

**What it does now:**
The orchestrator is the single entry point for every operation — study sessions, ML pipelines, research jobs, knowledge indexing, agent dispatch, operator memory, and workspace snapshots. It holds references to 15+ injected services and coordinates state transitions under a shared `_gate` semaphore.

**Why it is under pressure:**
- Adding a new desk workflow requires modifying this file regardless of whether the change is related to other areas.
- All state reads go through the same `SemaphoreSlim`, making selective locking impossible without touching the orchestrator.
- Test coverage requires constructing the entire orchestrator graph, even for tests that only exercise one domain (e.g., study session scoring).

**Refactor direction:**
Split into domain coordinators:
- `StudySessionCoordinator` — practice, defense, reflection, scoring. ✅ Extracted to `DailyDesk.Core/Services/StudySessionCoordinator.cs` but not yet delegated from `OfficeBrokerOrchestrator`.
- `ResearchCoordinator` — research jobs, watchlist, enrichment. ✅ Extracted to `DailyDesk.Core/Services/ResearchCoordinator.cs` but not yet delegated from `OfficeBrokerOrchestrator`.
- `MLPipelineCoordinator` — ML job dispatch, result retrieval, export artifacts. ✅ Extracted and wired: `OfficeBrokerOrchestrator` now holds `_mlPipelineCoordinator` and delegates all ML pipeline methods to it.
- `KnowledgeCoordinator` — import, indexing, context building. ✅ Extracted to `DailyDesk.Core/Services/KnowledgeCoordinator.cs` but not yet delegated from `OfficeBrokerOrchestrator`.

Keep `OfficeBrokerOrchestrator` as a thin facade that delegates to these coordinators. The facade boundary means `Program.cs` endpoints do not change callers.

**Action steps:**
1. In `OfficeBrokerOrchestrator.cs`, add a `StudySessionCoordinator studyCoordinator` constructor parameter and store it in a `_studyCoordinator` private field.
2. Locate all study-session method bodies (`StartPracticeAsync`, `SubmitPracticeResponseAsync`, `RunDefenseAsync`, `RecordReflectionAsync`, `ScorePracticeSessionAsync`) and replace each implementation body with a single delegation call to the corresponding method on `_studyCoordinator`.
3. Add a `ResearchCoordinator researchCoordinator` constructor parameter and `_researchCoordinator` field. Replace all research-job method bodies (`RunResearchJobAsync`, `SaveResearchReportAsync`, `GetWatchlistAsync`, and related helpers) with delegation calls to `_researchCoordinator`.
4. Add a `KnowledgeCoordinator knowledgeCoordinator` constructor parameter and `_knowledgeCoordinator` field. Replace all knowledge-import and indexing method bodies (`ImportKnowledgeAsync`, `IndexKnowledgeAsync`, `BuildContextAsync`, and related helpers) with delegation calls to `_knowledgeCoordinator`.
5. Remove any private service fields in `OfficeBrokerOrchestrator` that are now only referenced by the delegated coordinators (those fields belong in the coordinators, not the facade).
6. Register `StudySessionCoordinator`, `ResearchCoordinator`, and `KnowledgeCoordinator` in the broker DI container (`Program.cs`) as singletons alongside `MLPipelineCoordinator`, then add them to `OfficeBrokerOrchestrator`'s service registration.
7. Update all tests that construct `OfficeBrokerOrchestrator` directly (search for `new OfficeBrokerOrchestrator(`) to supply the new coordinator constructor arguments. Use the same builder helpers already present in `OrchestratorGraphIntegrationTests` as a reference.
8. Run `OrchestratorGraphIntegrationTests` and the full test suite (`dotnet test DailyDesk.Core.Tests`). Expected: same pass count as before and no new failures.

**Prerequisite:** No blocking prerequisite. Wire coordinators the same way `MLPipelineCoordinator` was wired — see its commit history as a reference pattern.

## Medium Pressure

These areas add maintenance overhead but do not block current development.

### 2. MLAnalyticsService — Redundant In-Memory TTL Cache

| | |
|---|---|
| **File** | `DailyDesk/Services/MLAnalyticsService.cs` |
| **Phase introduced** | Phase 1 |
| **Made redundant by** | Phase 3 (`MLResultStore`, LiteDB) |

**What it does now:**
`MLAnalyticsService` maintains an in-memory 5-minute TTL cache for analytics, forecast, and embeddings results (`_cachedAnalytics`, `_cachedEmbeddings`, `_cachedForecast`). This was added before the async job model existed.

**Why it is under pressure:**
- `MLResultStore` (Phase 3) now persists the latest result for each ML type in LiteDB. Callers can retrieve a persistent, restart-safe result from `MLResultStore` at any time.
- The in-memory cache and `MLResultStore` can diverge: a fresh run persisted to LiteDB will not be reflected in the in-memory cache until the TTL expires.
- `InvalidateCache()` must be called explicitly after a job completes, creating a coordination requirement between `OfficeJobWorker` and `MLAnalyticsService`.

**Refactor direction:**
1. Remove the `_cachedAnalytics`, `_cachedEmbeddings`, `_cachedForecast` fields and all TTL-management code (`_cacheTime`, `_cacheExpiry`) from `MLAnalyticsService`.
2. At each read site that previously returned a cached value, replace it with a direct call to `MLResultStore.GetLatestAnalytics()`, `MLResultStore.GetLatestEmbeddings()`, or `MLResultStore.GetLatestForecast()` as appropriate.
3. Replace `InvalidateCache()` with a no-op stub so all existing callers compile without change. Add a `// TODO: remove after all callers are updated` comment to the stub.
4. Confirm that all ML endpoint integration tests still pass after the replacement.
5. Search for all `InvalidateCache()` call sites (e.g., in `OfficeJobWorker`), remove them, then delete the no-op stub from `MLAnalyticsService`.

**Prerequisite:** Confirm `MLResultStore` returns a non-null result for all three ML types after a job completes. Covered by existing Phase 3 integration tests.

---

### 3. ML Endpoints — `?sync=true` Backward Compatibility Path

| | |
|---|---|
| **Files** | `DailyDesk.Broker/Endpoints/MLEndpoints.cs` |
| **Phase introduced** | Phase 3 (async job model) |
| **Removal condition** | WPF client fully migrated to job polling (Phase 9 complete) |

**What it does now:**
Six ML endpoints (`/api/ml/analytics`, `/forecast`, `/embeddings`, `/pipeline`, `/export-artifacts`, `/ml/index-knowledge`) accept a `?sync=true` query parameter that switches them back to synchronous blocking behavior. This was added to allow gradual migration of callers during the Phase 3 async transition.

**Why it is under pressure:**
- The synchronous code path is a duplicate of the pre-Phase-3 blocking logic. Both paths must be kept in sync when the ML execution logic changes.
- `sync=true` callers bypass job lifecycle tracking (no job ID, no status polling, no retention).
- Phase 9 (WPF async integration) adds `JobPollingService` to the WPF client. Once the client migrates to polling, the sync path has no remaining legitimate callers.

**Refactor direction:**
After confirming no active callers use `?sync=true`:
1. Remove the `sync` query parameter check from each endpoint.
2. Remove the inline blocking code path in each handler.
3. Update `CURRENT-STATE.md` to reflect that ML endpoints are async-only.

**Prerequisite:** Phase 9 WPF client migration complete and validated on the target workstation. Run a one-time audit to confirm no callers pass `?sync=true`.

### 4. MLAnalyticsService — Dual ONNX/Python Execution with Stale Availability Check

| | |
|---|---|
| **File** | `DailyDesk/Services/MLAnalyticsService.cs` |
| **Phase introduced** | Phase 7 (ONNX engine added alongside existing Python path) |

**What it does now:**
`MLAnalyticsService` has a three-tier execution order for each ML operation: ONNX model (if file present) → Python subprocess → computed fallback. Python availability is checked once at first use via `IsPythonAvailable()`, result is cached in `_pythonAvailable` (a `bool?` field), and never re-evaluated for the lifetime of the process.

**Why it is under pressure:**
- A Python environment installed or removed after the first check will never be detected. The process must be restarted to reflect a change in Python availability.
- All three ML types (analytics, embeddings, forecast) each have their own ONNX check, Python fallback, and hardcoded fallback calculation — roughly 60 lines of near-identical control flow repeated three times.
- Artifacts generation (`GenerateMLArtifactsAsync`) is Python-only with no ONNX path, meaning it silently returns a fallback bundle on workstations without Python even when the ONNX engine is otherwise healthy.

**Refactor direction:**
1. Extract the three-tier execution pattern (ONNX → Python → fallback) into a private generic helper `TryExecuteAsync<T>(Func<T?> onnxFn, Func<Task<T?>> pythonFn, Func<T> fallbackFn)`.
2. Replace the cached `bool? _pythonAvailable` field with a short-lived check (e.g., re-evaluate at most once per 5 minutes) so Python environment changes are picked up without restarting.
3. Add an ONNX-based artifacts generation path or document the Python-only limitation explicitly in a code comment and in `CURRENT-STATE.md`.

**Prerequisite:** No blocking prerequisite. Refactor can be done independently. Verify all ML endpoint integration tests still pass after the helper extraction.

### 5. KnowledgeImportService — Python Subprocess Dependency for Rich Extraction

| | |
|---|---|
| **File** | `DailyDesk/Services/KnowledgeImportService.cs` |
| **Phase introduced** | Phase 7 (Docling pipeline) |

**What it does now:**
`KnowledgeImportService` invokes an external Python script (`_pythonScriptPath`) via `ProcessRunner` for all rich document extraction (PDF, DOCX, PPTX, OneNote packages). If the script is absent or Python is unavailable, extraction throws `FileNotFoundException` or `InvalidOperationException`. The service also hard-caps document loading at 64 files per call (`.Take(64)`) with no configuration surface.

**Why it is under pressure:**
- The Python script path is passed as a constructor argument with no validation until the first extraction call, making configuration errors silent until runtime.
- The 64-document cap is an unexplained magic number. Large knowledge libraries silently drop newer documents beyond the cap.
- There is no fallback for unsupported file types — if the Python script fails mid-import, the entire `LoadAsync` call throws and the partial document list is discarded.
- Deployment on a machine without Python (e.g., a locked-down workstation) breaks all rich-format knowledge import with no degraded-mode behavior.

**Refactor direction:**
1. Validate `_pythonScriptPath` at construction time (or at `LoadAsync` startup) and log a clear warning if the script is absent, then continue with only built-in text/markdown extraction rather than throwing.
2. Replace the hard-coded `64` with a configurable `MaxDocuments` property (default 64, settable via `DailyDeskSettings`).
3. Catch per-document extraction exceptions inside the loop, log the failure, and continue with a `LearningDocument` that carries only the filename and an error flag — so a single corrupt PDF does not abort the entire import.

**Prerequisite:** No blocking prerequisite. Validate against the existing `KnowledgeImportServiceTests` suite after each sub-step.

---

## Low Pressure

These areas are well-understood technical debt that does not need immediate action but should be tracked.

### 6. Store JSON Export — Dropbox Compatibility Holdover

| | |
|---|---|
| **Files** | `DailyDesk/Services/TrainingStore.cs`, `DailyDesk/Services/OperatorMemoryStore.cs`, `DailyDesk.Core/Services/OfficeSessionStateStore.cs` |
| **Phase introduced** | Phase 2 (LiteDB migration) |

**What it does now:**
All three stores maintain a JSON export path alongside LiteDB storage. JSON export was kept after the Phase 2 migration to preserve Dropbox sync compatibility (`training-history.json`, `operator-memory.json`, `broker-live-session.json`).

**Why it is under pressure:**
- JSON export is a secondary write on every save, increasing write amplification.
- The export files can be modified out-of-band (e.g., manual edits in Dropbox), and the conflict resolution behavior between the JSON file and LiteDB is not explicit.
- The fallback logic (load JSON if LiteDB fails) remains but has not been exercised since the LiteDB migration stabilized.

**Refactor direction:**
Once LiteDB has been proven stable across multiple workstations:
1. Remove the on-save JSON export from each store.
2. Keep a one-time `ExportToJson()` utility method for manual snapshot/debugging.
3. Remove the `LoadFromJson` fallback path or demote it to a one-time migration-only path.

**Prerequisite:** Confirm LiteDB stability on all active workstations. Keep the export path until then.

### 7. OnnxMLEngine — Coarse Single Lock Across Independent Model Sessions

| | |
|---|---|
| **File** | `DailyDesk/Services/OnnxMLEngine.cs` |
| **Phase introduced** | Phase 7 (ONNX in-process engine) |

**What it does now:**
`OnnxMLEngine` manages three independent `InferenceSession` instances (analytics, embeddings, forecast), each loaded lazily from disk. All lazy-load paths share a single `_sessionLock` object, meaning a slow cold-start of one model type blocks the other two from initializing concurrently.

**Why it is under pressure:**
- Once all three sessions are warm the shared lock is uncontested, but the first cold-start (e.g., when the WPF client sends three ML requests close together after a restart) serializes what could otherwise be parallel model loads.
- The `Dispose()` method sets a `_disposed` flag but does not null the session references, so a use-after-dispose will still dereference the `InferenceSession` objects and throw an `ObjectDisposedException` from within the ONNX Runtime rather than a clean `ObjectDisposedException` from the engine itself.

**Refactor direction:**
1. Replace the single `_sessionLock` with three separate per-model locks (`_analyticsLock`, `_embeddingsLock`, `_forecastLock`) so concurrent cold-starts for different model types do not block each other.
2. In `Dispose()`, null the session fields after disposing them to prevent post-dispose use from reaching the ONNX Runtime.

**Prerequisite:** No blocking prerequisite. Changes are confined to `OnnxMLEngine.cs`. Verify with the existing ONNX engine unit tests.

### 8. WPF MainViewModel — Partial Class Growth

| | |
|---|---|
| **Files** | `DailyDesk/ViewModels/MainViewModel.cs`, `DailyDesk/ViewModels/MainViewModel.Operator.cs`, `DailyDesk/ViewModels/MainViewModel.Workflow.cs`, `DailyDesk/ViewModels/MainViewModel.OfficeChat.cs`, `DailyDesk/ViewModels/MainViewModel.OfficeDesks.cs`, `DailyDesk/ViewModels/MainViewModel.Guide.cs` |
| **Combined size** | ~4,200+ lines |
| **Phase introduced** | Phase 1 (grew through Phase 9) |

**What it does now:**
The WPF ViewModel is split across 6 partial class files. Each file handles a domain (operator memory, workflow automation, chat routing, desk selection, training guide).

**Why it is under pressure:**
- The partial class approach manages file size but does not enforce boundaries. One partial class can freely call or modify state from another, and frequently does.
- The desk-specific chat logic in `MainViewModel.OfficeDesks.cs` and `MainViewModel.OfficeChat.cs` will grow as Phase 9 async polling matures (job polling, streaming responses, status display).

**Refactor direction:**
Convert to ViewModel-per-desk as the SK agent desks mature (post Phase 9):
- `OperatorViewModel` — operator memory, inbox, suggestions.
- `StudyViewModel` — training, practice, defense, reflection.
- `ResearchViewModel` — research jobs, watchlist.
- `WorkflowViewModel` — schedules, daily-run, workflow templates.

Keep `MainViewModel` as a shell that navigates between desk ViewModels. This mirrors the SK agent desk model established in Phase 6.

**Prerequisite:** Phase 9 async integration stabilized. Defer until WPF job polling is confirmed working.
